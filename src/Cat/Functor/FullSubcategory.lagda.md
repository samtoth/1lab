# Full subcategories

A **full subcategory** $\cD$ of some larger category $\cC$ is the
category generated by some [predicate] $P$ on the objects of of
$\cC$: You keep only those objects for which $P$ holds, and all the
morphisms between them. An example is the category of [[abelian groups]], as
a full subcategory of [[groups]]: being abelian is a proposition (there's
"at most one way for a group to be abelian").

[predicate]: 1Lab.HLevel.html#is-prop

We can interpret full subcategories, by analogy, as being the "induced
subgraphs" of the categorical world: Keep only some of the vertices
(objects), but all of the arrows (arrows) between them.

```agda
record Restrict-ob (P : C.Ob → Type ℓ) : Type (o ⊔ ℓ) where
  no-eta-equality
  constructor restrict
  field
    object  : C.Ob
    witness : P object

open Restrict-ob public

Restrict : (P : C.Ob → Type ℓ) → Precategory (o ⊔ ℓ) h
Restrict P .Ob = Restrict-ob P
Restrict P .Hom A B = C.Hom (A .object) (B .object)
Restrict P .Hom-set _ _ = C.Hom-set _ _
Restrict P .id    = C.id
Restrict P ._∘_   = C._∘_
Restrict P .idr   = C.idr
Restrict P .idl   = C.idl
Restrict P .assoc = C.assoc
```

A very important property of full subcategories (`Restrict`{.Agda}ions)
is that _any full subcategory of a [[univalent category]] is univalent_. The
argument is roughly as follows: Since $\cC$ is univalent, an
isomorphism $A \cong B$ gives us a path $A \equiv B$, so in particular
if we know $A \cong B$ and $P(A)$, then we have $P(B)$. But, since the
morphisms in the full subcategory coincide with those of $\cC$, any
iso in the subcategory is an iso in $\cC$, thus a path!

```agda
module _ (P : C.Ob → Type ℓ) where
  import Cat.Reasoning (Restrict P) as R
```

We begin by translating between isomorphisms in the subcategory (called
$\cR$ here) and in $\cC$, which can be done by destructuring and
reassembling:

```agda
  sub-iso→super-iso : ∀ {A B : Restrict-ob P} → (A R.≅ B) → (A .object C.≅ B .object)
  sub-iso→super-iso x = C.make-iso x.to x.from x.invl x.invr
    where module x = R._≅_ x

  super-iso→sub-iso : ∀ {A B : Restrict-ob P} → (A .object C.≅ B .object) → (A R.≅ B)
  super-iso→sub-iso y = R.make-iso y.to y.from y.invl y.invr
    where module y = C._≅_ y
```

```agda
module _ (P : C.Ob → Type ℓ) (pprop : ∀ x → is-prop (P x))
  where
  import Cat.Reasoning (Restrict P) as R
```

We then prove that object-isomorphism pairs in the subcategory (i.e.
inhabitants of $\sum_{B : \cR} (A \cong B)$) coincide with those in
the supercategory; Hence, since $\cC$ is by assumption univalent, so
is $\cR$.

```agda
  Restrict-is-category : is-category C → is-category (Restrict P)
  Restrict-is-category cids = λ where
    .to-path im i .object → Univalent.iso→path cids (sub-iso→super-iso P im) i
    .to-path {a = a} {b = b} im i .witness → is-prop→pathp
      (λ i → pprop (cids .to-path (sub-iso→super-iso P im) i))
      (a .witness) (b .witness) i
    .to-path-over p → R.≅-pathp _ _ λ i → cids .to-path-over (sub-iso→super-iso P p) i .C.to
```

## From full inclusions

There is another way of representing full subcategories: By giving a
_full inclusion_, i.e. a [[fully faithful]] functor $F : \cD \to
\cC$. Each full inclusion canonically determines a full subcategory
of $\cC$, namely that consisting of the objects in $\cC$ merely in
the image of $F$.

```agda
module _ {o' h'} {D : Precategory o' h'} {F : Functor D C} (ff : is-fully-faithful F) where
  open Functor F

  Full-inclusion→Full-subcat : Precategory _ _
  Full-inclusion→Full-subcat =
    Restrict (λ x → ∃[ d ∈ Ob D ] (F₀ d C.≅ x))
```

This canonical full subcategory is weakly equivalent to $\cD$,
meaning that it admits a fully faithful, [essentially surjective]
functor from $\cD$. This functor is actually just $F$ again:

[essentially surjective]: Cat.Functor.Properties.html#essential-fibres

```agda
  Ff-domain→Full-subcat : Functor D Full-inclusion→Full-subcat
  Ff-domain→Full-subcat .Functor.F₀ x = restrict (F₀ x) (inc (x , C.id-iso))
  Ff-domain→Full-subcat .Functor.F₁ = F₁
  Ff-domain→Full-subcat .Functor.F-id = F-id
  Ff-domain→Full-subcat .Functor.F-∘ = F-∘

  is-fully-faithful-domain→Full-subcat : is-fully-faithful Ff-domain→Full-subcat
  is-fully-faithful-domain→Full-subcat = ff

  is-eso-domain→Full-subcat : is-eso Ff-domain→Full-subcat
  is-eso-domain→Full-subcat yo =
    ∥-∥-map (λ (preimg , isom) → preimg , super-iso→sub-iso _ isom)
      (yo .witness)
```

Up to weak equivalence, admitting a full inclusion is equivalent to
being a full subcategory: Every full subcategory admits a full
inclusion, given on objects by projecting the first component and on
morphisms by the identity function.

```agda
module _ {P : C.Ob → Type ℓ} where
  Forget-full-subcat : Functor (Restrict P) C
  Forget-full-subcat .Functor.F₀ = object
  Forget-full-subcat .Functor.F₁ f = f
  Forget-full-subcat .Functor.F-id = refl
  Forget-full-subcat .Functor.F-∘ f g i = f C.∘ g

  is-fully-faithful-Forget-full-subcat : is-fully-faithful Forget-full-subcat
  is-fully-faithful-Forget-full-subcat = id-equiv
```
