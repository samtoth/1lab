# Initial objects {defines="initial-object"}

An object $\bot$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be **initial**
if there exists a _unique_ map to any other object:

```agda
is-initial : Ob → Type _
is-initial ob = ∀ x → is-contr (Hom ob x)

record Initial : Type (o ⊔ h) where
  field
    bot  : Ob
    has⊥ : is-initial bot
```

We refer to the centre of contraction as `¡`{.Agda}. Since it inhabits a
contractible type, it is unique.

```agda
  ¡ : ∀ {x} → Hom bot x
  ¡ = has⊥ _ .centre

  ¡-unique : ∀ {x} (h : Hom bot x) → ¡ ≡ h
  ¡-unique = has⊥ _ .paths

  ¡-unique₂ : ∀ {x} (f g : Hom bot x) → f ≡ g
  ¡-unique₂ = is-contr→is-prop (has⊥ _)

open Initial
```

## Intuition

The intuition here is that we ought to think about an initial object as
having "the least amount of structure possible", insofar that it can be
mapped _into_ any other object. For the category of `Sets`{.Agda}, this
is the empty set; there is no required structure beyond "being a set",
so the empty set sufficies.

In more structured categories, the situation becomes a bit more
interesting. Once our category has enough structure that we can't build
maps from a totally trivial thing, the initial object begins to behave
like a notion of **Syntax** for our category.  The idea here is that we
have a _unique_ means of interpreting our syntax into any other object,
which is exhibited by the universal map `¡`{.Agda}

## Uniqueness

One important fact about initial objects is that they are **unique** up
to isomorphism:

```agda
⊥-unique : (i i' : Initial) → bot i ≅ bot i'
⊥-unique i i' = make-iso (¡ i) (¡ i') (¡-unique₂ i' _ _) (¡-unique₂ i _ _)
```

Additionally, if $C$ is a category, then the space of initial objects is
a proposition:

```agda
⊥-is-prop : is-category C → is-prop Initial
⊥-is-prop ccat x1 x2 i .bot =
  Univalent.iso→path ccat (⊥-unique x1 x2) i

⊥-is-prop ccat x1 x2 i .has⊥ ob =
  is-prop→pathp
    (λ i → is-contr-is-prop
      {A = Hom (Univalent.iso→path ccat (⊥-unique x1 x2) i) _})
    (x1 .has⊥ ob) (x2 .has⊥ ob) i
```

## Strictness

An initial object is said to be *[strict]* if every morphism into it is an *iso*morphism.
This is a categorical generalization of the fact that if one can write a function $X \to \bot$ then $X$ must itself be empty.

This is an instance of the more general notion of [van Kampen colimits].

[van Kampen colimits]: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/van+Kampen+colimit


```agda
is-strict-initial : Initial → Type _
is-strict-initial i = ∀ x → (f : Hom x (i .bot)) → is-invertible f

record Strict-initial : Type (o ⊔ h) where
  field
    initial : Initial
    has-is-strict : is-strict-initial initial
```

Strictness is a property of, not structure on, an initial object.

```agda
is-strict-initial-is-prop : ∀ i → is-prop (is-strict-initial i)
is-strict-initial-is-prop i = hlevel 1
```
